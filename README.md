# Proof

This is a proof assistant, similar to Coq or Lean.

It's meant to be very simple on the language level, while also supporting features such as proof automation and interactive visualizations.


Proofs related to geometry, topology, complexity, etc. will be prioritized.



Some builtin notions:
* logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
* Set, equality, union, intersect, complement, power set, etc.
* natural number mapping
* peano acceleration
* definition/axiom equivalence checking, definition casting
